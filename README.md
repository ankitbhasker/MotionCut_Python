Project Overview:

The Quiz Project is a command-line based application written in Python that allows users to take a quiz on a specific topic. The project aims to provide an interactive and engaging way to assess knowledge and understanding.

Key Features:

1. Question Bank: A collection of questions and answers stored in a data structure (e.g., dictionary, list, or JSON file).
2. Quiz Interface: A user-friendly interface that displays questions, accepts user input, and provides feedback.
3. Scoring System: Keeps track of correct and incorrect answers, calculating the final score at the end of the quiz.
4. Randomization: Questions are randomly selected from the question bank to ensure a unique quiz experience each time.
5. User Input Validation: Ensures users enter valid responses (e.g., A, B, C, or D).

Possible Functionalities:

1. Quiz Categories: Allow users to choose from different categories (e.g., history, science, sports, music).
2. Difficulty Levels: Offer varying levels of difficulty (e.g., easy, medium, hard).
3. Timer: Set a time limit for the quiz or individual questions.
4. Leaderboard: Store and display top scores.

Python Concepts Used:

1. Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
2. Control structures (if-else, for loops)
3. Functions
4. File input/output (for storing question bank)
5. Randomization (using the random module)

This project is an excellent opportunity to practice Python programming fundamentals while creating an engaging and interactiveÂ application.
